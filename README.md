# Isorhythm
Pure Data and Max For Live implementations of isorhythm sequencing.

[Isorhythm on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isorhythm)

The idea here is to decouple a melody's rhythm events and sequence of pitches. Then the number of rhythm events and pitches can be different, and we iterate through pitches on each rhythm event.
